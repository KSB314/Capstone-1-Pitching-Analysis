# Capstone 1 Pitching Analysis

Using the Sean Lahmans Baseball Database, this is a demonstration for the use of an student T-test. 

Background: There is a myth in the history of baseball that a left handed pitcher vs right handed hitters creates a slight advantage. This may be true on individual circumstances, but a historical account of the left handed pitchers vs right handed pitchers is necessary to investigate this myth. It is established that there are more right handed hitters than left handed hitters in this dataset, therefore if left handed pitchers are truely better then there should also be a statistically significant difference between opposing batting average (OBA) for left handed pitchers compared to right handed pitchers. 


Hypothesis: Using the student T-test as a demonstration, is there a statistical difference between left and right handed pitchers? 

Experimental Design: 
    Independent Variable: Left or Right handedness of the pitcher 
    Test-Variable : Opponents Batting Average (BAOpp) is a continuous variable between the range of zero and one. It is a percentage of hits per total at bats.  
    Sample: 1000 randomly selected pitchers from each handed group for a total of sample size of 2000. 
    Distribution: Normally distributed 
    Hypothesis: If there is a difference in group means the null hypothesis will be rejected and handedness of the pitcher is in advantage.
    Analysis: Student t-test with a critical value of 1.96 and alpha value of 0.05, confidence interval of 95%. 

Results: 
    After checking all the assumptions for the use of the t-test, a t-value and p-value were calculated at 0.59 and 0.55 respectfully. 
    Null hypthesis is accepted, and there is not a statistically significant differnce between left and right handed pitchers. 
    
    
    According to opposing batting average, the left handed pitcher myth is busted.
